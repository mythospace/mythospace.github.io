Reality is merely a concept within our minds. Consensus reality is a conceptualization of reality which is *more-or-less* shared and implicitly agreed upon by the majority of beings in our immediate experience. The whole mess is arbitrary, and trying to pin down what is *really* real becomes a philosophical exercise. With the scientific method and rigor, great minds are attempting to tease out the limits of consensus reality in the physical space. However we are realizing that at the very core of physical existence, the state of matter itself, is dependent upon the observer of said matter. Even what we deem as the hardest of hard sciences is still a subjective projection of the truth.

With this in mind, I claim that every conceivable future event is a possiblility with some remote probability of coming to fruition and being accepted as the consensus reality. The only certainty we can claim to have is our understanding, measurement, and observations of *past* events, which may even be a stretch. The present is the point at which uncertainty, all possibilities, is experienced, played out, and collapsed into a single expression of what did happen -- this is occuring constantly. The practice of awareness is remaining in the space where possibility is collapsing as opposed to the space where unchanged certainty exists (in the past) or unreliable projections exist (in the future). One can never be let down while living in the present moment.

The concepts of certainty and reliability are useful for planning and survival and have done well for us to a certain point. But like all lenses through which we view the universe, they are inherently limiting. Uncertainty is the mother of potential.

Unexpected events come to pass are only a detriment to the extent that our future and happiness was wrapped up in some mutually exclusive, expected events. Expected events are based on our concept of certainty and reliability projected into the future of linear time; they are based on a single possible collapse of all wave functions in the universe and are entirely fictitious to a high degree of probability. The more defined the expected event is, the lower the likelihood that it comes to pass as expected. These tools of projection are simply that, tools, concepts, ways of understanding.

There are then two lessons or guidelines to be aware of as we build our Reality:
* Expected events are not reality. Present happiness and identity *can not* be tied to expected future events. ("No expectations")
* Unexpected events are an opportunity to *refine* our understanding of how things come to be.
