This experience is full of symbolism. By social conditioning, or some thread running deep throughout the human species, I project my thought patterns outward upon seemingly external events and objects. The degree to which I am able to replicate my world in here with the world out there, is the degree to which I find meaning in physical reality. Having an internal story consistent with the external world validates one's existence. We therefore naturally attribute meaning to disparate stimuli.

A husband and wife are out walking on a beautiful autumn day. The sun was shining and the air was only a bit cold. On this day, his focus was taken, not by the scene unfolding before them, but by financial matters. He went on and on, telling her about this and that financial smallness as if it had true meaning in our lives.

She reminds him, "Sometimes you don't seem to care at all of spending money, other times it causes you to be stressed, I never know what to expect." She is right. And he is caught up.

He keeps talking in circles about the same things, making the same points in a different way. At that, the sky darkened all around and it begins pouring rain.

They both got quite wet.

By the time they returned to their starting point, the sun had come out again and a rainbow could be seen to the east.

Matters of finance concern us greatly when one operates close to the physical world, for money is the key to physical comfort and opportunity in our society. However, allowing one's mental state to become dependent upon such matters outside of immediate control does not serve, we must all accept our lot. Accepting that the rain clouds will form, carry out their universal destiny, and dissipate, is accepting that everything in the dualistic realm is a cycle. Being concerned that one is getting wet is of little consequence to the cloud, or the water droplets. We grow when we accept the consequences of our choices; when we accept the lessons being shown to us.
