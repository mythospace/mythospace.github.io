I'm sorry about all the stickiness the last two days.

I won't say never again again because I'm playing out this karmic debt and that
would be naive.

But this time I have gathered yet more pieces and built a stronger understanding.

Thank you for staying strong and being you. You are literally my anchor, and I
also apologize that you must carry that heavy weight. However, it is with great
gratitude that I keep walking forward with you in this incarnation and the
greater cosmic play unfolding.

From the bottom of my heart and the essence of my being:

Thank you.
